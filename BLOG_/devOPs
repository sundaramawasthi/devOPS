  THE DevOps Journey -

      Hey Everybody nice to see you here !
    
      I am Sundram Awasthi, student, flutter developer and a DevOpS,OpenSource euthisiam.
      Recently Started my DevOps Journey ,In this Journey I earn achivement and knowledge.
      I am here to share it because i think that would also helpfull to other people to there
      DevOps Journey.


      So , Lets get started with a beautifull question why DevOps ? 

      Why DevOPs -

        I think the first question arise in everyone mind in this journey is that why we learn 
        devOps intead of we have many other approch that help to software development process
        also.


        IN A EARLY PERIOD FOR THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WE HAVE A METHODOLOGY 
        THAT CALLED A WATER FALL METHODOLOGY
                    
                     WATERFALL METHODOLOGY -
                       
                     WATER FALL METHODOLOGY IS ONE OF THE BASIC METHODOLOGY THAT USE IN many
                     DIFFERENT PLACES .
                     ITS HAS A MULTIPLE PHASES AS -
                      REQUIRMENT->DESIGNEMENT->IMPLEMENT ->TESTING->DEPLOYMENT ->MAINTANCE 
                       SO WE HAVE 6 PHASES OVER HERE -
                       
                       REQUIRMENT PHASE -{ IN REQUIRMENT PHASE BASICALLY PEOPLE SET TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT ARE THE REQUIRMENT 
                       FOR THE PRODUCT FUNCTIONAL AND NON-FUNCTIONAL SERVICES THAT THEY ARE DEVELOPED. }

                       DESIGNING PHASE -{ IN DESIGNING PHASE THEY START PLANING OF THESE THING BASE 
                       ON REQUIRMENT THAT THEY ARE DISCUSS EARLIER , THEY ASSIGNE TASK TO SPECIFIC TEAM
                       THEY SCHEDULE TASK TO HAPPENA AT A CERTAIN TIME THEY ALSO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH
                       RESOURCE TO PERFORM CERTAIN TASK }

                       IMPLEMENT PHASE -{IMPLEMENTAIO PHASSE IS PHASE WHERE YOU GO AND DEVELOPED
                       THE  SOFTWARE}
         
                       TESTING - { IN TESTING PHASE WE GOHEAD AND TEST OUR SOFTWARE FOR A SPECIFIC
                       THING ,TEST BASE OF REQUIRMENT, THEY DO INTEGRATING TESTING AND ETC}

                       DEPLOYMENT -{ SOFTWARE IS GIVEN TO THE FINAL END USER , THAT USER START TO USE}

                       MAINTANCE PHASE { IN MAINTAINANCE PHASE WE MAINTAIN THE SOFTWARE IF THERE IS ANY CRUSH ON IT}

                       PROBLEM WITH WATERFALL MODEL -

                         THE PROBLEM OCCUR WITH WATERFALL MODEL IS IT VERY LONG PROCESS GENERALLY IT TAKE MONTHS TO 
                         COMPLETE IT .
                         IN EARLY DAY WHEN WATERFALL MODEL COMES IT USED IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ALSO IN VARIOUS FILED,
                         BUT IN TODAYS AGE USE HAVE MANY DIFFERNT KIND OF USE CASES AND DIFFERENT CENERIO WHERE YOU CON 
                         NOT USE THESE MODEL.
