JENKINS -> building, reporting , deployment , testing ,integrating .

Achive CI with jenkins using git or maven 




                                                  OVERVIEW - 


                CICD PIPELINE -

                    CICD pipeline automates your software delivery process. 

                    PIPElINE do { Built Code , run test , Safe deployment}

                    Automated pipeline remove manual error and provide stadralized feedback .


                               CONTINEOUS INTEGARTION -

                       It is development practice in which all developer code integrate as early as possible .
  
                        KEYPOINT IN CI -

                                 NEED TO COMMIT THE CHANGES IN THE SOURCE CODE 
                                 { EVERY COMMIT CHANGES IN THE SOURCE CODE IS THE BUILT}
                                 REQUIRE RAGULAR BUILT 
                                 WHENEVER CODE OCCUR BUILT SHOULD BE TRIGGER

                                1. GENERATING AND ANALYING REPORT 
                                2. DEVELOPING AND COMPILING
                                3 .PERFORMING FUNCTIONAL TEST AND LABLE CODE.

                                5. PREPRODUCTION Deployment
                                6. DATABASE INTEGRATION 
                    


                    ADVANTAGE OF CONTINEOUS INTEGRATION - 
                      
                Moniter the health of code coverage metrics

                Reduce technical dept and maintance Cost 

                Publicly visible Code quality metrices .

                Automated end to end acceptance test 

                Reduce risk by provide faster feedback 

                Help identifying the fix integration and regression 

                Help simply and accelerate delivery 

                Automates deployment process.

                allow quick access of software.


                                         CONTIOUS DELIVERY -

                                             Contineous delivery is extention of contineous integration.
                                             After the  built stage automatic deploy all code changes.



                                            CD PROCESS IS NOT AUTOMATED 
                                            BUSINESS TEAM DECIDE THE BEST TIME TO DELIVER THE LATEST CHANGE
                                             IN IMPLEMENT OF CD , GOAL IS TO DEPLOYMENT 


                     CONTINEOUS DEPLOYMENT -

                Contineous deployment is a step up of contineous delivery
                in which every change deploy automatically without explicit prrocess

                Its is a software release stragetgy in which each code commit that passes
                automated testing is automatically sent to production 


                       BENIFIT OF CONTINEOUS DEPLOYMENT - 

                    FASTER RETURN 
                    FASTER FEEDBACK
